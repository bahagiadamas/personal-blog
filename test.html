  On May 10th and 12th, 2023, I had the opportunity to be part of an initiative
  aimed at empowering small-scale shrimp farmers in Kebumen. Through this event,
  we introduced the Jagoan Tambak program, designed to help farmers optimize
  their water quality management and improve their shrimp cultivation
  efficiency.

<p>
  Water quality management is one of the most crucial aspects of aquaculture.
  During the workshop, my team and I shared practical and data-driven
  techniques, helping farmers understand how factors such as pH levels, oxygen
  concentration, and water temperature impact shrimp growth.

<p>
  Beyond the educational sessions, we also introduced the JALA App, a digital
  platform that enables farmers to monitor their water quality and track their
  farm’s progress in real-time. This application allows them to make more
  informed decisions based on accurate data, helping them manage their farms
  more efficiently and sustainably.

<h2>Reflections from Kebumen</h2>
<p>
  Seeing the enthusiasm of shrimp farmers as they embraced new knowledge and
  applied it to their practices was an invaluable experience for me. Programs
  like these demonstrate that with education and technology, we can help
  small-scale farmers grow and navigate industry challenges with confidence.
